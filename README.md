## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the webpage and UI elements.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for an elegant, modern UI.
- **JavaScript**: Fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically displaying content.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Fetching real-time weather data for current and forecast conditions.

## How to Run Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A text editor like VSCode or Sublime Text.
- A web browser like Chrome or Firefox.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Get your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and replace it in the `script.js` file where it says `const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'`.

4. Open `index.html` in a browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

5. Search for any city to see the current weather and the hourly forecast!

## API Integration

This app integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Current Weather Data**: The API provides temperature, weather condition (e.g., clear sky, rain), and a corresponding weather icon.
- **Forecast Data**: The API delivers a 5-day forecast, which is sliced to show the next 24 hours (in 3-hour intervals).

### API Endpoints Used

- **Current Weather API**:  
  `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}`
  
- **5-Day / 3-Hour Forecast API**:  
  `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}`

## Improvements

Here are a few future improvements that could be made to the app:

- Add location-based weather detection using the browser's Geolocation API.
- Implement error handling for invalid city names or API request failures with custom error pages.
- Include more weather details like humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times.
- Add unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Cache data for faster performance and reduced API calls.
