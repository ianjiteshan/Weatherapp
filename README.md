## Deployment

### Deploying on [Railway.app](https://railway.app)

To deploy the Weather App on [Railway.app](https://railway.app), follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up/Log In to Railway**  
   - Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up (or log in if you already have an account).

2. **Create a New Project**
   - Click **New Project** on the dashboard.
   - Select **Deploy from GitHub Repo**. You will be prompted to connect your GitHub account if you haven't done so.

3. **Connect Your GitHub Repository**
   - Select your GitHub repository that contains the Weather App code. 
   - If you haven't pushed your project to GitHub, do so using the following commands:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```

4. **Configure Static Site Deployment**
   - Go to **Settings** in your Railway project.
   - Under the "Static Site" settings:
     - **Build Command**: Leave this blank since it's a static site.
     - **Start Command**: No start command needed for a static site.
     - **Output Directory**: Set to `/` (root directory).

5. **Set Environment Variables (Optional)**
   - If you're using API keys, go to **Variables** in Railway and add your API key:
     - Key: `API_KEY`
     - Value: `your-openweathermap-api-key`

6. **Deploy**
   - Click the **Deploy** button, and Railway will deploy your Weather App.
   - After deployment, Railway will provide a live URL for your app.

7. **Access Your App**
   - Visit your deployed Weather App at the provided Railway URL.

## API Integration

This app integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Current Weather Data**: The API provides temperature, weather condition (e.g., clear sky, rain), and a corresponding weather icon.
- **Forecast Data**: The API delivers a 5-day forecast, which is sliced to show the next 24 hours (in 3-hour intervals).

### API Endpoints Used

- **Current Weather API**:  
  `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}`
  
- **5-Day / 3-Hour Forecast API**:  
  `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}`

## Improvements

Here are a few future improvements that could be made to the app:

- Add location-based weather detection using the browser's Geolocation API.
- Implement error handling for invalid city names or API request failures with custom error pages.
- Include more weather details like humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times.
- Add unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Cache data for faster performance and reduced API calls.
